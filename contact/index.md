If you have an issue/bug report/feature suggestion for any of my projects, I would prefer that you open an issue on the project's GitHub issue tracker so that my answers can help anyone else facing the same difficulties.

Otherwise, feel free to email me directly at [`jvilk@REMOVEME.cs.umass.edu`](mailto:jvilk@REMOVEME.cs.umass.edu).

Snail mail can be directed at my school mailbox:

<ul class="simplelist">
  <li>Room 354</li>
  <li>Department of Computer Science</li>
  <li>140 Governors Drive</li>
  <li>Amherst, MA 01003</li>
  <li>USA</li>
</ul>
