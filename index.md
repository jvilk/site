# Research

My research aims to improve the browser as an application platform by making it easier to write, debug, and optimize complex web applications.
To that end, my research interests include debugging, software performance, operating systems, and programming languages.

> **A Gray Box Approach For High-Fidelity High-Speed Time-Travel Debugging**
>
> ***John Vilk**, James Mickens, and Mark Marron*

>
> Time-travel debugging (TTD) lets developers step backward as well as forward through a programâ€™s execution. TTD is a powerful mechanism for diagnosing bugs, but previous approaches suffer from poor performance due to checkpoint and logging overhead, or poor fidelity because important information like GUI state is not tracked.
>
>In this paper, we describe how to provide high-performance and high-fidelity TTD to programs written in managed languages. Previous high-performance debuggers treat components external to the program like the GUI as black boxes, but that is not sufficient for high-fidelity time-travel. Instead, we advocate for a gray-box approach that keeps these components live and in sync with the program during time-travel. The key insight is that managed runtime APIs expose most of the functionality required to do this; where it does not, we extend the runtime with a small number of non-intrusive interrogative interfaces. To demonstrate the power of our gray-box approach, we implement ReJS, a time-traveling debugger for web applications. ReJS imposes imperceptible tracing overhead, and its logs typically grow less than 1 KB/s. As a result, ReJS is performant enough to be deployed in the wild; real client machines can ship buggy execution traces across the wide area to developer-side machines for debugging.

> **Browsix: Bridging the Gap Between Unix and the Browser**
>
> *Bobby Powers, **John Vilk**, and Emery D. Berger*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Applications written to run on conventional operating systems typically depend on OS abstractions like processes, pipes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system. Porting these applications to the web currently requires extensive rewriting or hosting significant portions of code server-side because browsers present a nontraditional runtime environment that lacks OS functionality.
>
> This paper presents Browsix, a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix comprises two core parts: (1) a JavaScript-only system that makes core Unix features (including pipes, concurrent processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system) available to web applications; and (2) extended JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js that support running programs written in these languages as processes in the browser. Browsix supports running a POSIX shell, making it straightforward to connect applications together via pipes.
>
> We illustrate Browsix's capabilities via case studies that demonstrate how it eases porting legacy applications to the browser and enables new functionality. We demonstrate a Browsix-enabled LaTeX editor that operates by executing unmodified versions of pdfLaTeX and BibTeX. This browser-only LaTeX editor can render documents in seconds, making it fast enough to be practical. We further demonstrate how Browsix lets us port a client-server application to run entirely in the browser for disconnected operation. Creating these applications required less than 50 lines of glue code and no code modifications, demonstrating how easily Browsix can be used to build sophisticated web applications from existing parts without modification.

> **SurroundWeb: Mitigating Privacy Concerns in a 3D Web Browser**
>
> ***John Vilk**, David Molnar, Eyal Ofek, Chris Rossbach, Benjamin Livshits, Alexander Moshchuk, Helen J. Wang, and Ran Gal*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Immersive experiences that mix digital and real-world objects are becoming reality, but they raise serious privacy concerns as they require real-time sensor input. SurroundWeb is the first 3D web browser that provides the novel functionality of rendering web content onto a room while tackling many of the inherent privacy challenges. Following the principle of least privilege, we propose three abstractions for immersive rendering:
>
> 1. The *room skeleton* lets applications place content in response to the physical dimensions and locations of renderable surfaces in a room.
> 2. The *detection sandbox* lets applications declaratively place content near recognized objects in the room without revealing if the object is present.
> 3. *Satellite screens* let applications display content across devices registered with SurroundWeb.
>
> We implement these abstractions in a prototype system, and demonstrate that a wide range of immersive experiences can be implemented  with acceptable performance. SurroundWeb will appear at [IEEE Security and Privacy 2015](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2015/).

> Doppio is a JavaScript-based runtime system that makes it possible to run unaltered applications written in general-purpose languages directly inside the browser. Doppio provides a wide range of runtime services, including a file system that enables local and external (cloud-based) storage, an unmanaged heap, sockets, blocking I/O, and multiple threads. We demonstrate Doppio's usefulness with two case studies: we extend Emscripten with Doppio, letting it run an unmodified C++ application in the browser with full functionality, and present DoppioJVM, an interpreter that runs unmodified JVM programs directly in the browser. This work appeared at [PLDI 2014](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/pldi2014/), won the [Distinguished Artifact Award](http://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/), and was selected as a [SIGPLAN Research Highlight](http://www.sigplan.org/Newsletters/CACM/Papers/)!

> DoppioJVM is currently used by the University of Illinois at [CodeMoo.com](http://codemoo.com/) to teach children how to program in Java, and components of Doppio are used by the [MS-DOS Collection](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games/v2) at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

# Side Projects

Occasionally, I find the time to work on some fun side projects.

> **MakeTypes: TypeScript Types from JSON Examples**
>
> MakeTypes lets developers typecheck code that interacts with JSON services
> by generating TypeScript types from JSON examples. MakeTypes can also optionally
> perform *runtime type checking* to enforce these types at runtime, guarding code
> against unexpected service responses.
>
> MakeTypes uses the Common Preferred Shape Relation from [this PLDI paper](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2908115).

> **TypeScript Generator for Dropbox's Stone**
>
> Stone is a language-agnostic specification language for APIs. Stone's generators can generate
> SDKs for a variety of languages from a Stone specification, including JavaScript.
>
> I mapped [Stone's types onto TypeScript's type system](https://github.com/dropbox/stone/pull/14),
> and implemented a Stone generator that produces TypeScript definition files for its JavaScript
> generator.
>
> This generator will [eventually provide TypeScript types for the Dropbox JavaScript SDK.](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-js/pull/96)

> **MS-DOS Collection at the Internet Archive**
>
> The [MS-DOS Collection](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games/v2) at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) relies on [Doppio's file system](https://github.com/jvilk/browserfs) to make a large collection of DOS games playable in the browser.
> I added support for [union mounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_mount) into the file system to support layering a mutable file system on top of an immutable zip file,
> making it possible to save game progress to in-browser storage.
> I also worked with archive employees to integrate the file system appropriately, and to address a complex Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue that prevented the initial deployment from working in Internet Explorer and Safari.

> **JSMESS: Multi Emulator Super System in JavaScript**
>
> The [JSMESS](http://jsmess.textfiles.com/) project aims to port the [Multi Emulator Super System (MESS)](http://mess.org/) to JavaScript to enable accurate and embeddable vintage computer and video game console emulators in the browser. This project has enabled the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) to provide its visitors with interactive demos of vintage and historical software for educational purposes. We use [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) along with tweaks to the MESS source code to accomplish this feat.

> **SDL Joystick Support in Emscripten**
>
> I augmented [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/)'s SDL emulation with support for the SDL Joystick API using the [HTML5 Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/). As a result, SDL applications ported to the web with Emscripten, such as JSMESS, will function appropriately with USB gamepads. This code has been integrated into the Emscripten code base, and is present in Emscripten releases since v1.7.3.
