# Research

My research spans software systems, programming languages, and software engineering, with a focus on overcoming challenges posed by web application development.
My research interests include, but are not limited to, software debugging, performance, portability, and reliability.

> **ReJS: Time-Travel Debugging for Browser-Based Applications**
>
> ***John Vilk**, James Mickens, and Mark Marron*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Browser-based applications are difficult to debug because they are inherently nondeterministic. Network requests can intermittently fail or return unexpected results, JavaScript events can race with one another, and JavaScript code can race with the browser's renderer. Traditional stepping debuggers provide little help to developers trying to debug these issues.
>
> We present ReJS, the first time-traveling debugger for browser-based applications that lets developers step forward and backward in time to isolate non-determinacy bugs. ReJS faithfully and efficiently reproduces nondeterministic behavior, and supports existing GUI debugging tools during time-travel because it keeps the browser's renderer live and in sync with JavaScript execution. To make time-travel possible, we extend the renderer with a small number of non-intrusive *interrogative interfaces* that expose previously hidden runtime information. ReJS imposes imperceptible tracing overhead, its logs typically grow less than 1 KB/s, and, after a one-time startup delay, stepping backward is as fast as stepping forward. Core parts of ReJS have been incorporated into Microsoft's ChakraCore JavaScript engine, which ships in Windows 10.

> **BLeak: Automatically Debugging Memory Leaks in Web Applications**
>
> ***John Vilk** and Emery D. Berger*
>{: .authorlist}
>
>Despite the presence of garbage collection in managed languages like JavaScript, memory leaks remain a serious problem. In the context of web applications, these leaks are especially pervasive and difficult to debug.  Web application memory leaks can take many forms, including failing to dispose of unneeded event listeners, repeatedly injecting iframes and CSS files, and failing to call cleanup routines in third-party libraries. Leaks degrade responsiveness by increasing GC frequency and overhead, and can even lead to browser tab crashes by exhausting available memory. Because previous leak detection approaches designed for conventional C, C++ or Java applications are ineffective in the browser environment, tracking down leaks currently requires intensive manual effort by web developers.
>
> This paper introduces BLeak (**B**rowser **Leak** debugger), the first system for automatically debugging memory leaks
> in web applications. BLeak's algorithms leverage the observation that in modern web applications, users often repeatedly return to the same (approximate) visual state (e.g., the inbox view in Gmail). Sustained growth between round trips is a strong indicator of a memory leak. To use BLeak, a developer writes a short script (â‰ˆ40 LOC) to drive a web application in round trips to the same visual state. BLeak then automatically generates a list of leaks found along with their root causes, ranked by severity. Guided by BLeak, we identify and fix over 50 memory leaks in popular libraries and apps including Airbnb, AngularJS, Google Analytics, Google Maps SDK, and jQuery. BLeak's median precision is 100%; fixing the leaks it identifies reduces heap growth by an average of 94%, saving from 0.5 MB to 8 MB per round trip.

> **Browsix: Bridging the Gap Between Unix and the Browser**
>
> *Bobby Powers, **John Vilk**, and Emery D. Berger*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Applications written to run on conventional operating systems typically depend on OS abstractions like processes, pipes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system. Porting these applications to the web currently requires extensive rewriting or hosting significant portions of code server-side because browsers present a nontraditional runtime environment that lacks OS functionality.
>
> This paper presents Browsix, a framework that bridges the considerable gap between conventional operating systems and the browser, enabling unmodified programs expecting a Unix-like environment to run directly in the browser. Browsix comprises two core parts: (1) a JavaScript-only system that makes core Unix features (including pipes, concurrent processes, signals, sockets, and a shared file system) available to web applications; and (2) extended JavaScript runtimes for C, C++, Go, and Node.js that support running programs written in these languages as processes in the browser. Browsix supports running a POSIX shell, making it straightforward to connect applications together via pipes.
>
> We illustrate Browsix's capabilities via case studies that demonstrate how it eases porting legacy applications to the browser and enables new functionality. We demonstrate a Browsix-enabled LaTeX editor that operates by executing unmodified versions of pdfLaTeX and BibTeX. This browser-only LaTeX editor can render documents in seconds, making it fast enough to be practical. We further demonstrate how Browsix lets us port a client-server application to run entirely in the browser for disconnected operation. Creating these applications required less than 50 lines of glue code and no code modifications, demonstrating how easily Browsix can be used to build sophisticated web applications from existing parts without modification.

> **SurroundWeb: Mitigating Privacy Concerns in a 3D Web Browser**
>
> ***John Vilk**, David Molnar, Eyal Ofek, Chris Rossbach, Benjamin Livshits, Alexander Moshchuk, Helen J. Wang, and Ran Gal*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Immersive experiences that mix digital and real-world objects are becoming reality, but they raise serious privacy concerns as they require real-time sensor input. SurroundWeb is the first 3D web browser that provides the novel functionality of rendering web content onto a room while tackling many of the inherent privacy challenges. Following the principle of least privilege, we propose three abstractions for immersive rendering:
>
> 1. The *room skeleton* lets applications place content in response to the physical dimensions and locations of renderable surfaces in a room.
> 2. The *detection sandbox* lets applications declaratively place content near recognized objects in the room without revealing if the object is present.
> 3. *Satellite screens* let applications display content across devices registered with SurroundWeb.
>
> We implement these abstractions in a prototype system, and demonstrate that a wide range of immersive experiences can be implemented  with acceptable performance. SurroundWeb will appear at [IEEE Security and Privacy 2015](http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2015/).

> ***John Vilk** and Emery D. Berger*
>{: .authorlist}
>
> Doppio is a JavaScript-based runtime system that makes it possible to run unaltered applications written in general-purpose languages directly inside the browser. Doppio provides a wide range of runtime services, including a file system that enables local and external (cloud-based) storage, an unmanaged heap, sockets, blocking I/O, and multiple threads. We demonstrate Doppio's usefulness with two case studies: we extend Emscripten with Doppio, letting it run an unmodified C++ application in the browser with full functionality, and present DoppioJVM, an interpreter that runs unmodified JVM programs directly in the browser. This work appeared at [PLDI 2014](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/pldi2014/), won the [Distinguished Artifact Award](http://pldi14-aec.cs.brown.edu/), and was selected as a [SIGPLAN Research Highlight](http://www.sigplan.org/Newsletters/CACM/Papers/)!
>
> DoppioJVM is currently used by the University of Illinois at [CodeMoo.com](http://codemoo.com/) to teach students how to program in Java, and Doppio is used by the [Software Collection](https://archive.org/details/software) at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) to bring historical software to life in the browser.

# Side Projects

Occasionally, I find the time to work on some fun side projects.

> **MakeTypes: TypeScript Types from JSON Examples**
>
> MakeTypes lets developers typecheck code that interacts with JSON services
> by generating TypeScript types from JSON examples. MakeTypes can also optionally
> perform *runtime type checking* to enforce these types at runtime, guarding code
> against unexpected service responses.
>
> MakeTypes uses the Common Preferred Shape Relation from [Petricek et al. (PLD16)](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2908115).

> **TypeScript Generator for Dropbox's Stone**
>
> Stone is a language-agnostic specification language for APIs. Stone's generators can generate
> SDKs for a variety of languages from a Stone specification, including JavaScript.
>
> I mapped [Stone's type system onto TypeScript's type system](https://github.com/dropbox/stone/pull/14),
> and implemented a Stone generator that produces TypeScript definition files from a Stone API
> specification.

> **SDL Joystick Support in Emscripten**
>
> I augmented [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/)'s SDL emulation with support for the SDL Joystick API using the [HTML5 Gamepad API](http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/). As a result, SDL applications ported to the web with Emscripten, such as JSMESS, will function appropriately with USB gamepads. This code has been integrated into the Emscripten code base, and is present in Emscripten releases since v1.7.3.
